Introduction
============

This is a small tool for processing saved netflow data files (with nfcapd from
the nfdump program suite[1]) and filter out scans on one port over a range of ips.

'make' should do all the work, see ./nfportscan -h for usage information.

Several files have been taken from the original nfdump sourcecode, each file contains
