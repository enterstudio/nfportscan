Introduction
============

This is a small tool for processing saved netflow data files (with nfcapd from
the nfdump program suite[1]) and filter out scans on one port over a range of ips.

The function ExpandRecord() and the files file.h and nffile.h are taken from
the original nfdump sourcecode.

'make' should do all the work, see ./nfportscan -h for usage information.

License
=======

The files file.h, file.c and nffile.h are covered by the BSD license (taken
from nfdump), the rest is licensed as GPL, version 2.  See the file LICENSE for
more information.
